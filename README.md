I am running through the Basic Tutorial on GIT repositories and hence making these changes through a branch called 'readme-edits'.

A brief about me: I am a Data & Machine Learning Architect and QA Automation Manager with 15+ years of experience in Machine Learning, Big Data, Business & Data Analytics, Hadoop, Data visualizations etc.
